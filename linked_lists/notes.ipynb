    "* A singly linked list is a collection of **_nodes_** that form a linear sequence.\n",
    "* Each node stores a reference to an object (or _value_) which represents an element in the sequence. Additionally, the node stores a reference to the next node in the list.\n",
    "* The List instance maintains a member named `head` that identifies the first node in the list. Some applications have a `tail` that represents last node in the list.\n",
    "* The `tail` has `None` as its next reference.\n",

    "    1. Create a new node\n",
    "    2. Set its element to the new element\n",

    " \n",
    "* **Removing** a node from the head is easy. We simply set the List head to the node that the previous head references.\n",
    "* Removing a tail node is not as easy. In a singly linked list, the references go one way. Thus, it's easy to find the tail if the list instance references it. However, to find the next to last node, we have to traverse all the way from the top.\n",

    "### Advantages over singly linked list\n",
    "1. A DLL can be traversed in both forward and backward direction.\n",
    "2. The delete operation in DLL is more efficient if pointer to the node to be deleted is given.\n",
    "3. We can quickly insert a new node before a given node.\n",
    "4. In singly linked list, to delete a node, pointer to the previous node is needed. To get this previous node, sometimes the list is traversed. In DLL, we can get the previous node using previous pointer.\n",

    "### Disadvantages over singly linked list\n",
    "1. Every node of DLL Require extra space for an previous pointer. It is possible to implement DLL with single pointer though (See this and this).\n",
    "2. All operations require an extra pointer previous to be maintained. For example, in insertion, we need to modify previous pointers together with next pointers. For example in following functions for insertions at different positions, we need 1 or 2 extra steps to set previous pointer."
