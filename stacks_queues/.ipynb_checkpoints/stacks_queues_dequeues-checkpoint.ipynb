    "* Stacks are an ordered collection of items where addition and removal of items takes place at the same end (called the **_top_**)\n",
    "* The opposite end of the _top_ (or the bottom of the stack) is called the **_base_**\n",
    "* Items closest to the base represent those items that have been in the stack the longest. Those closests to the top are the newest.\n",
    "* Stacks represent a _last in, first out_ principle for ordering (**_LIFO_**)\n",
    "* Stacks are great tools for reversing the order of items, as the order of insertion is the reverse of the order of removal.\n",
